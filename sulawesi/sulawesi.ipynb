    "This dynamic rupture earthquake scenario, featuring sustained supershear rupture propagation, matches key earthquake observational data, including its moment magnitude, rupture duration, fault plane solution, teleseismic waveforms, and inferred horizontal ground displacements. All faults are loaded by a uniform stress regime reflecting regional transtension which leads to spontaneous accumulation of a combination of up to 6 m left-lateral slip and up to 2 m normal slip on the fault segment dipping 65 degrees East beneath Palu Bay. We will see that the dynamic rupture model produces overall left-lateral, dominantly strike-slip faulting across the curved, bend, connected fault segments. \n",
