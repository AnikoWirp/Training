    "This earthquake scenario, featuring sustained supershear rupture propagation, matches key earthquake observational data, including its moment magnitude, rupture duration, fault plane solution, teleseismic waveforms and inferred horizontal ground displacements. The applied remote stress regime reflecting regional transtension, produces a combination of up to 6 m left-lateral slip and up to 2 m normal slip on the straight fault segment dipping 65 degree East beneath Palu Bay. We will model left-lateral, dominantly strike-slip faulting on bend, connected fault segments. \n",

Arrows indicate the far-field plate velocities with respect to Eurasia (Socquet et al. 2006). The black box corresponds to the region displayed in b. b A zoom of the region of interest. The site of the harbor tide gauge of Pantoloan is indicated as well as the city of Palu. Locations of the GPS stations at which we provide synthetic ground displacement time series (see Appendix 7.2) are indicated by the red triangles. Focal mechanisms and epicenters of the September 28, 2018 Palu earthquake (USGS (2018a), top), October 1, 2018 Palu aftershock (middle), and January 23, 2005 Sulawesi earthquake (bottom) are shown. These later two events provide constraints on the dip angles of individual segments of the fault network. Individual fault segments of the Palu-Koro fault used in the dynamic rupture model are coloured. c, d, e 3D model of the fault network viewed from top, SW and S*\n"

    "1. Creating a high resolution topography and bathymetry free surface and merge it with a simple 3D volume (e.g. a box);\n",
    "2. Creating the complex fault network constrained by fault traces and varying fault dip and intersect with topo-bathymetry;\n",
    "3. Automatic volumetric meshing using unstructured tetrahedral elements. Keep in mind resolution criteria: the CFL criterion for wave propagation, and the dynamic rutpure process zone, the region behind the rupture front where the fault strength drops from its static to dynamic level (Day et al., 2005; for SeisSol: [Wollherr et al., 2018](https://academic.oup.com/gji/article/214/3/1556/5017447?login=true)).\n",

The prescribed resolution here is 800 m element edge length everywhere on the fault, and rapid static coarsening away from the fault system. This mesh has ~215k elements. The high-resolution mesh for comparison consists of 8 million elements, decreasing the shortest element edge lengths to 200 m close to faults."
